            I knew I made an excellent decision after reviewing the ring at my local jeweler. It was better than expected. Personnel showing me the ring commented on how my selection was a great buy (thanks to Ritani's resources). The brilliance and fire that comes off of the diamond is crazy. My fianc√©e continually receives comments on the beauty of her ring from friends and strangers.

            The ring looks great. It was nice to have the selection of Ritani's at your fingertips. Moreso, the process of having it sent to a local jeweler made it even better. The jeweler put me under no pressure to purchase the ring. I would recommend Ritani's selection and process to anyone who appreciates high quality rings...and provides an educational and easy process.

            After visiting traditional high-end retailers and then seeing the Ritani settings at a local jeweler, we are extremely impressed and happy with the final product. The Palladium setting is very elegant, high quality and with an excellent craftsmanship. The sidestones and center diamond have so much fire and brilliance that my fiance gets compliments on a daily basis. Considering the high quality of Ritani's settings, the vast diamond selection and the convenient In-Store Preview, this is hands down the best way to get the perfect engagement ring.<br>
            Service: The Ritani jeweler in our neighborhood was extremely friendly and helpful in helping us pick the right setting. Having someone to get advice from was a huge benefit. Once we were decided, I used the In-Store Preview option and the final ring arrived at the store very quickly. The purchasing experience was seamless. I honestly could not be happier with the service.
